ProblemProblems Data Base 

This applicaiton is a tool for the tutoring center I work with part time.

Our staff is made of peer tutors, and sometimes due to staffing or subject matter, we cannot always provide the expertise students need to have their questions addressed.

This tool is meant to aggrigate those questions, so that tutors can address them asynchronously.

It also serves as a lookup resorce where students and tutors can utilize drop down filters to quickly find examples related to specific topics for reference.

This project is in the early stages of deployment and I am excited to leave it with the staff and watch it iterate, expand, and develope.
Thank you so much for this opportunity !!

All the files required to work on this project in Visual Studio should be present.
Simply clone a copy of the repository, and take a look around!
