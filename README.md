The ProblemProblems data base is a tool for the tutoring center.
Our staff is made of peer tutors, and sometimes due to staffing or subject matter we cannot always provide the expertise students need to have their questions addressed.
This tool is meant to aggrigate those questions so that tutors can address those questions asynchronously.
It also serves as a lookup resorce where students and tutors can quickly find examples related to specific topics for reference.
This project is in the early stages of deployment and I am excited to leave it with the staff and watch it iterate, expand, and develope.
Thank you so much for this opportunity !! <3
